Each element in the collection is appended to the specified elements and the original collection returned.

    Pablo.circle().appendTo(paper);

If `elements` is an element name string and an `attributes` object is supplied, or if `elements` is an array of element names, then new elements will be created and appended for each element in the collection:

    paper.circle()
        // Append to single created element
        .appendTo('g', {})
        // Append to multiple created elements
        .append(['g', 'symbol']);

The attributes object is optional when an array of element names is passed, but required if a single element name is passed (otherwise, the single element name would be treated as a CSS selector).

If the collection contains multiple elements, each specified element gets cloned after it is first appended.

    Pablo(['g', 'g'])
        .append('#foo');
    // the #foo element is appended to the first <g>
    // then it is cloned before being appended to the second <g>
