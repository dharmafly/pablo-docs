As with [remove][remove], this removed each element in the collection from its parent in the DOM, but it _does not remove_ any associated  data or events.

In the example below the event will still be triggered because detaching from a parent does not remove its event.

    var parent = Pablo.ellipse(),
        rect   = Pablo.rect();

    parent.append(rect);

    rect.on('foo', function () {
      alert('Triggered!')
    });

    rect.trigger('foo');

    parent.firstChild().detach();

    rect.trigger('foo');
    alert(parent.children().length);
