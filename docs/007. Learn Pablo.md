# Browser support

<span id="has-browser-support"></span>

Pablo and SVG is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=svg" target="_blank">supported in all modern browsers</a>, including Internet Explorer 9 and mobile web browsers. IE9 does not support some SVG features, like animation.

To test if a particular browser or device is supported by Pablo, <a href="/tests/" target="_blank">run the test suite</a> on the device. [Read more](/misc/#tests) about the test suite and detecting support at runtime.

<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
        _site.browsersupport('#has-browser-support');
    }, false);
</script>


# Inspiration

Pablo's is inspired by [jQuery][jquery], [Underscore][_], [Backbone][backbone] and [RaphaÃ«l][raphael], although knowledge of these libraries isn't required.

Pablo is quite different from [D3][d3]. D3 is a purpose-built data visualisation tool, with a slightly steep learning curve at the start. By comparison, Pablo is a tool to create interactive drawings and animations in general, and it is fairly easy to learn. Pablo can definitely be used to create data visualisations, but for anything complex, D3 is the tool to use.

Pablo gives access to the browser's full support for SVG, HTML and CSS, so a growing knowledge of these technologies will help to get the most out of Pablo. (See the [Resources][resources] page for some useful links).
