To test if a particular browser or device is supported by Pablo, <a href="/tests/" target="_blank">run the test suite</a> on the device.

If you need to run the tests locally, checkout the repo and open `tests/index.html` in the browser. For the Ajax tests to pass, you should run from a localhost server.

To test for support at runtime, use [`Pablo.isSupported`](/api/Pablo.isSupported/) to check basic SVG support and [`Pablo.support`](/api/Pablo.support/) for fine-grained feature support.
