Loads an external SVG file via an Ajax request and appends it to each element in the collection. An optional `callback` function will be called after this has completed. If the `replace` argument is `true`, the elements will be emptied before the new contents is appended.

The `callback` is passed two arguments: 1) a collection of the new contents and 2) the XMLHttpRequest object used to load the file. Within the callback, the `this` object will be the original collection.

    Pablo(demoElement).load('/images/villain.svg');
