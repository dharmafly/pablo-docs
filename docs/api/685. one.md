Adds the listener to each element in the collection, but removes the listener as soon as it has been triggered once, on *any* of the elements. Returns the collection.

    var rect = Pablo.rect();
    
    function print () {
      alert("triggered");
    }

    rect.one('foo', print);
    rect.trigger('foo');
    rect.trigger('foo');
    // Should only have printed once
