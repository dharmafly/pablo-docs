Loads an external SVG file via an Ajax request and appends it to each element in the collection. The full DOM tree from the SVG image will be appended to the collection's elements. This is distinct from appending an image using the [`image()`](/api/elements/#Element-reference) element method, where only a single DOM element to represent the image is added.

An optional `callback` function is called after this has completed. If the `replace` argument is `true`, the container element(s) will be emptied before the loaded content is appended.

The `callback` is passed two arguments: 1) a collection of the new contents and 2) the XMLHttpRequest object used to load the file. Within the callback, the `this` object will be the original collection.

    Pablo(demoElement).load('/assets/villain.svg');
