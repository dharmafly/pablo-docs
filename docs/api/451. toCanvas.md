Converts the collection to an HTML `<canvas>` element and returns the canvas. The canvas will be resized to fit its contents.

    var canvas = Pablo.circle({r:50}).toCanvas();

    canvas.appendTo(demoElement);
    alert(demoElement.innerHTML);


# toCanvas(callback)

As above, but passes the collection containing the `<canvas>` element to the `callback` function when the image has been applied to the canvas. The callback's `this` object will be the original collection.


# toCanvas(callback, canvas)

As above, but will apply an image of the collection to an existing `canvas` element (or a collection containing the canvas).


# Browser support

All modern browsers support HTML canvas. To confirm, check that `Pablo.support.canvas === true`.

    if (Pablo.support.canvas){
        // create canvas
    }
    else {
        // fallback
    }
