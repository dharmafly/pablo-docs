Pablo provides methods like `circle()` and `line()` to create each kind of SVG element. There are methods for manipulating SVG and HTML, to change the appearance, size, position or some other property. There are also methods for filtering and sorting elements. The simple plugin system allows new functionality to be added.

Using Pablo is to use SVG, so a growing knowledge of SVG goes hand-in-hand with using the library. See the [Resources][resources] page for links and books on SVG.

_Tip: In the docs, you can click and edit any code snippets that have 'Run' buttons._
