If the collection contains anything other than a single `<svg>` element, it will append the elements in the collection to a new `<svg>` container, crop the container to its contents and return the container.

If the collection already contains a single `<svg>` element, then it will just be returned.

This is useful for operations that need to work on an `<svg>` container and is used internally, for example by the [`dataUrl()`](/api/dataUrl/) and [`markup()`](/api/markup/) methods.

    var svg = Pablo.circle({r:50}).withViewport();

    svg.appendTo(demoElement);
    alert(svg[0].nodeName);
