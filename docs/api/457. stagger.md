heading: stagger(fn, [options])
---

Calls the iterator function for each element in the collection, one after another. The method returns a controller object to act as an interface for the animation, allowing it to be stopped and started, and firing events at key times.

    var svg = Pablo(demoElement).svg({width:500, height:100}),
        shapes = svg.circle().duplicate(2),
        colors = ['red', 'orange', 'green'];

    shapes.attr({
        fill: colors,
        r: 50,
        cx: [50, 160, 270],
        cy: 50
    });

    shapes.stagger(function(current, previous, i, lastIndex){
        Pablo(current).attr('fill', 'black');
        Pablo(previous).attr('fill', colors[lastIndex]);
    }, {
        t: 300,
        bounce: true,
        repeat: 10
    });


## Iterator function

The iterator function is called with the collection as `this` and passed several arguments: `current` - the current element in the sequence, `previous` - the previous element, `i` - the index of the current element in the collection, `lastIndex` - the index of the previous element.


## Options

### `t`

The delay between calling one element and the next, in milliseconds. Default: `1000`


### `defer`

Boolean for whether the animation should be called on the first element immediately (`false`) or after a delay of `options.t` (`true`). Default: `false`


### `repeat`

The number of repeats of the animation sequence before it stops. Use a value of `-1` to repeat indefinitely, until manually stopped. Default: `1`


### `autostart`

Boolean for whether the animation starts automatically on calling `stagger()`. Default: `true`


### `autodestroy`

Boolean for whether the controller object is destroyed, to free memory, when the animation completes. If set to `false`, then the animation can be allowed to complete, and then manually started again later. Call `destroy()` on the controller when it is no longer needed. Default: `true`


### `order`

Either `asc` or `desc`, to determines of the sequence should run in ascending order or descending (backwards). Default: `'asc'`


### `bounce`

Boolean to determing what order the animation will take once it completes a sequence. If `true`, the animation will flip the `asc` / `desc` order flag each time it reaches the end / start of the sequence. Default: `false`


## Controller object

### Properties:

### `active`

Boolean value for whether the staggered animation is currently active.

#### `lastIndex`

The index of the previously called element


### Methods:

#### `start()`

Start playing the animation from the beginning, or where it had been previously stopped.


#### `stop()`

Stop the animation. It can be resumed with `start()`.


#### `reset()`

Put the animation back to the start. This does not stop the animation.


#### `complete()`

Stops the animation and resets it.


#### `destroy()`

Frees memory by deleting objects in the controller. Should be called manually if `option.autodestroy` has been set to `false`.


#### Event methods

`on`, `one`, `oneEach`, `off`, `trigger`, for interacting with events on the controller object. These work in the same way as [controller Events](/api/#Events).


### Events:

#### `start`

Triggered when the animation starts.


#### `stop`

Triggered when the animation stops.


#### `begin`

Triggered when the first element in the sequence is reached.


#### `end`

Triggered when the last element in the sequence has been reached.


#### `complete`

Triggered when the animation sequence has completed and stopped.


#### `iteration`

Triggered for each element's iteration of the sequence.


#### `destroy`

Triggered when the animation is destroyed.
