Returns the value of the named CSS property from the _first_ element in the collection.

    var rect  = Pablo.rect({
        style: 'fill:orange; cursor:pointer'
    });

    alert(rect.css('cursor')); // 'pointer'

Note, this is not the computed style. This method only returns the value of CSS properties that have been set directly on the element, not those set in any stylesheet.
