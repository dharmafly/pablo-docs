Boolean `true` or `false`, denoting whether or not the current browser supports the web technologies required by Pablo.

Use this check in unknown environments to ensure that Pablo-specific code is only executed if the browser supports it.

Some discrepancies between browsers are supported, but Pabloâ€™s code is kept lean by targeting only modern desktop and mobile browsers. The browser must provide [basic SVG support](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg), as well as some [ECMAScript5 features](http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/) (the browsers that support SVG also usually support ECMAScript5). Pablo exits gracefully in non-supported browsers.

    if (Pablo.isSupported){
        alert('Pablo works!');
    }
    else {
        alert('Not supported!');
    }
