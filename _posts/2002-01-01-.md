Pablo is a JavaScript library for creating and manipulating SVG ([scalable vector graphics][svg]), which is the open standard for vector graphics on the web. Pablo focusses on simplicity and performance, targeting modern browsers for both desktop and mobile.

<!-- Testcard -->
<div id="testcard" style="margin-top:40px">
    <script>
        // Load, on DOM ready
        if ('addEventListener' in document){
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
                var script = document.createElement('script');
                document.body.appendChild(script);
                script.src = '/media/testcard.js';
            }, false);
        }
    </script>
</div>

## Pablo and SVG

Pablo can create anything that SVG can. It gives access to all of SVG's granularity and power, but without the verbose code in using raw JavaScript to manipulate SVG. Pablo's drawing methods are named after SVG elements, such as `<circle>` and `<line>`.


## Pablo's API

Pablo's API style is inspired by [jQuery][jquery]. The way it can manipulate collections of SVG elements is similar to [Underscore][_]. And the expressive way it creates shapes is inspired by [RaphaÃ«l][raphael]. However, knowledge of these other libraries is not important, and Pablo doesn't require these or any other libraries to be present - it is a standalone script. It aims to be lean, weighing in at around 5KB.
