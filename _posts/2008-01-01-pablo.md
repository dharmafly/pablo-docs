#### [pablo([element/selector], [attributes])](pablo)

Returns a collection based on the passed argument which can be 
a CSS selector or an element.

## Creating Pablo collections

A Pablo collection is a wrapper around a DOM element or multiple DOM elements. They work in a similar way to jQuery collections, which also wrap around DOM elements e.g. jQuery('img').

SVG elements are the main target for the library, but Pablo can also wrap other element types, such as HTML.

A Pablo collection behaves likes an array - it can contain zero, one or multiple elements - and it has a number of useful methods for manipulating the elements within.

## Collection methods

Collections also have a number of methods and properties, which manipulate the elements within the collection. In the documentation, these are written as `.methodName()`, e.g. `.append()`.

## Method chaining

Most methods return `this`, the collection. This allows methods to be chained, one after another.

    Pablo.circle()
        .addClass('foo')
        .append('rect', {width:50})
        .append('line', {})
        .on('click', function(){
            // clicked
        });
