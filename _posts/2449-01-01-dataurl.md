Converts the collection to a `.svg` file and returns the data URL that describes the contents of the file.

    var shape = Pablo.circle({r:50});
    alert(shape.dataUrl());

An `.svg` file must include a root `<svg>` element. If the collection does not contain a single `<svg>` element, its elements are cloned, appended to a new `<svg>` element and the `<svg>` element is cropped to fit the contents before the data URL is created.
