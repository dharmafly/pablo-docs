Any elements can be created with the [`Pablo()`](/api/pablo/) method. However, usually elements are created by calling a specific [element method](/api/elements/).


## [Pablo.ELEMENT_NAME(\[attributes\])](/api/elements/)

Creates a new element with the same name as the method, wrapped in a collection. E.g. to create a new `<circle>` element, call `Pablo.circle()`. Optional `attributes` can be passed.


## [ELEMENT_NAME(\[attributes\])](/api/elements/#elements-02)

The same element methods can be called directly on collections, to create and append a new element to each element in the collection
