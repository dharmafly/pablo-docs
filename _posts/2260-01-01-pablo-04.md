Creates a named element with the specified attributes, and returns it in a collection.

Attributes are given as properties and values of a JavaScript object.

    Pablo('rect', {x:10, y:10, width:50, height:50});

To create an element this way, the attributes object is required, even if it is empty. If the attributes argument is missing - in this example, giving `Pablo('rect')` - then Pablo will treat it as a _selection_ and would return all existing `<rect>` elements in the document.

Any SVG element can be created with this method. Typically though, elements are created with the [element shortcut methods][creation].


## Creating HTML

It is not possible to create HTML elements with this method. To achieve that, use `Pablo(document.createElement('div'))` or similar. (HTML creation may be supported in future).
