The tests can be used to check that a particular browser or device is supported by Pablo. Run the tests at [pablojs.com/tests][test].

Or run them locally by checking out the repo, running `grunt` in the `build` folder (see '[Build process][build]') and opening `tests/index.html` in the browser.

If you are developing Pablo, add to or update the tests in [`tests.js`][tests.js].
