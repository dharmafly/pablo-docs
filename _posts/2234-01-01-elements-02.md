The same element methods can be called directly on collections, to create and append a new element to each element in the collection:

    /* Create two groups */
    var group1 = Pablo.g(),
        group2 = Pablo.g(),
        groups = Pablo([group1, group2]);

    /* Create and append a circle and rectangle to each group */
    var circle = group.circle(),
        rectangle = group.rect({width: 50, height: 50});
