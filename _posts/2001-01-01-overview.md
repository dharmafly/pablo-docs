&#8202;<span class="project-name">Pablo</span>  is a lightweight, expressive JavaScript library for creating and manipulating collections (souped-up arrays) of [SVG][svg] elements, to generate interactive drawings. A bit like [RaphaÃ«l][raphael] + [jQuery][jquery] + [Underscore][_]. _In less than 3KB._

Pablo exposes a simple interface that gives access to all of SVG's granularity and power. The library stays lean by targetting the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, while failing gracefully elsewhere.

_Example uses:_ low-level, interactive drawing, data visualisation, game canvases, responsive graphics and rich visual interfaces.

Pablo can create anything that SVG can, but makes it simple for JavaScript to generate the graphics, manipulate them over time or hook them together with other parts of a JavaScript program.

[See the API Reference][reference] to discover Pablo's extensive API.
