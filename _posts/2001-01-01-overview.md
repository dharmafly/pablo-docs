&#8202;<span class="project-name">Pablo</span> is a lightweight, expressive JavaScript library to create interactive drawings with [SVG][svg] (Scalable Vector Graphics).

Pablo exposes a simple interface to create and manipulate SVG elements and complex structures, giving access to all of SVG's granularity and power. The library stays lean by targetting the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, and failing gracefully in older browsers.
