#### [pablo(elements, [attributes])](/api/pablo/)

Returns an array-like collection of DOM elements.

`elements` may be one or more DOM elements, including elements contained within
arrays, Pablo collections, jQuery collections or DOM node lists.

`elements` may also be a CSS selector to match elements in the global `document`.

`attributes`, if supplied will be set on each of the elements in the collection.


## `Pablo('<svg>markup</svg>')` is not _(yet)_ supported

Unlike jQuery, which allows HTML to be created by passing in HTML markup - 
e.g. `jQuery(&lt;div>markup&lt;div>);`, Pablo does not _(yet)_ support the 
creation of SVG elements by passing in SVG markup.

The reason for this is that SVG elements do not have an equivalent property to HTML
elements' `innerHTML`.

For a polyfill, to allow this functionality, see the [innerSVG](http://code.google.com/p/innersvg/) library.


## Collection methods

Collections also have a number of methods and properties, which manipulate the elements within the collection. In the documentation, these are written as `.methodName()`, e.g. `.append()`.


## Method chaining

Most collection methods return the collection, allowing methods to be chained
together:

    Pablo.circle()
        .addClass('foo')
        .append('rect', {width:50})
        .append('line', {})
        .on('click', function(){
            // clicked
        });
