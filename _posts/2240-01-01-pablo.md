Creates an empty Pablo collection.

When Pablo() is called without arguments, an empty Pablo collection is created and returned.

    var collection = Pablo();
    alert(collection.length);

This can be used as an empty container into which elements will later be added (see [.push()][push] and [related methods][collection-manipulation]).

    var collection = Pablo();
    
    collection.push(Pablo.circle());
    alert(collection.length);
