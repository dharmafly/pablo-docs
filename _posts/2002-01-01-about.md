Pablo is built on top of SVG ([scalable vector graphics][svg]), allowing graphics to be incorporated into websites and scripted from within web apps. It focusses on simplicity and performance, targeting modern browsers for both desktop and mobile.

Its API style is inspired by [jQuery][jquery]. The way it can manipulate collections of SVG elements is similar to [Underscore][_]. And the expressive way it creates shapes is inspired by [RaphaÃ«l][raphael]. However, knowledge of these other libraries is not important. It has no dependencies for other JavaScript libraries to be present. It aims to be lean, weighing in at around 5KB.


## Pablo and SVG

SVG is the web standard for creating vector graphics in the browser. Pablo can create anything that SVG can. It gives access to all of SVG's granularity and power, but without the hassle of writing raw JavaScript to manipulate SVG.

Pablo's drawing methods are named after SVG elements, such as `<circle>` and `<line>`, and higher-level drawing methods are generally avoided.

[See Pablo's API Reference][api] for details.
